# Learning-MLOps

*"MLOps stands for Machine Learning Operations. MLOps is a core function of Machine Learning engineering, focused on streamlining the process of taking machine learning models to production, and then maintaining and monitoring them. MLOps is a collaborative function, often comprising data scientists, devops engineers, and IT."* Source: [databricks](https://databricks.com/glossary/mlops#:~:text=MLOps%20stands%20for%20Machine%20Learning,then%20maintaining%20and%20monitoring%20them.)


*"MLOps is modeled on the existing discipline of DevOps, the modern practice of efficiently writing, deploying and running enterprise applications. DevOps got its start a decade ago as a way warring tribes of software developers (the Devs) and IT operations teams (the Ops) could collaborate."* Source: [NVIDIA](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/09/03/what-is-mlops/)
